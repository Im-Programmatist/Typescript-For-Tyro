/**
 * TypeScript supports  
 *      1. Static typing - variables are known at compile time
 *      2. Strongly type - each type of data is such as integer,string  is predefined
 *      3. Modules - Modules are a way to create a local scope in the file. It prevent default global scopes
 *      4. Optional Parameters - when it's not mandatory for that parameter to have a value or to be specified.
 *      5. object-oriented programming features such as classes, interfaces, inheritance, generics, etc.
 *      6. It is fast simple and easy to learn
 *      7. It highlighted mistake before script run, In compilation mode we get list of errors
 *      8. All javascript library and All Benefits of ES6 libraries/feature 
 *      9. The tooling support of TypeScript gives us autocompletion, type checking, and source documentation
 *      10. Portable, means run on any device where js runs
 *      11. Can be used to manipulate the DOM for adding or removing elements similar to JavaScript.
 * 
 * Disadvantage of TypeScript
 *      1. TypeScript takes a long time to compile the code.
 *      2. TypeScript does not support abstract classes.
 *      3. If we run the TypeScript application in the browser, a compilation step is required to transform TypeScript into JavaScript.
